# ✂️ Knip

Hi there!

Knip finds **unused files, dependencies and exports** in your JavaScript and TypeScript projects. Less code and
dependencies lead to improved performance, less maintenance and easier refactorings.

The documentation is available at [knip.dev][1].

This repository contains the source code of the [knip package][2] and the content for the [documentation website][1].

Contributions welcome! If you'd like to contribute, please start by reading the [contributing guide][3].

Do you feel lost? Feel free to join [Knip's Discord channel][4].
