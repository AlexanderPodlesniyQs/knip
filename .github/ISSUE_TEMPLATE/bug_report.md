<!--
No extensive forms or lists here. Please make sure you have read the docs and
are using the latest version of Knip. Use common sense and provide the necessary
information that helps me or others to help you. Depending on the type of issue,
it may be of great help (or you may be asked) to create a minimal reproduction.
A convenient way to do so is by forking one of these templates:

- CodeSandbox: https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/knip-reproduction-lk5zqx
- StackBlitz: https://stackblitz.com/edit/knip-case-repro?file=README.md&view=editor

Other solutions may work well too, the goal is to have an easy and common
understanding and reproduction.

Thanks!
